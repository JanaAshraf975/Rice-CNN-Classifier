# Rice-CNN-Classifier
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classifier trained on rice images to automatically predict rice varieties. The model is built with TensorFlow/Keras, trained on Kaggle, and deployed with Streamlit for an interactive web app.

ðŸŒ¾ Rice CNN Classifier

A deep learning project to classify rice grain images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The project includes a Streamlit-based interactive interface for predicting rice types from images.

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates:

Image classification using CNNs

Data preprocessing and augmentation

Model evaluation and visualization

Deployment with Streamlit for user-friendly interaction

The CNN model is trained on a rice image dataset and can predict among five rice types: Basmati, Jasmine, Arborio, Ipsala, and Karacadag.

ðŸ§ª Requirements

Python 3.8+

TensorFlow

Keras
